# Audio Spectrum Visualizer
This project is an Arduino powered audio visualizer that transforms live sound into moving patterns on a 32×8 LED matrix display. By combining a microphone sensor, real-time signal processing, and an animated display, it turns music and other sounds into a visual experience

For my first milestone, I created an audio visualizer using an Arduino Uno R3, a microphone sensor, and a 32×8 LED dot matrix display. The microphone detects sound and sends an analog signal to the Arduino, which processes the audio using a Fast Fourier Transform and displays the results as moving frequency bars on the LED matrix.

So far, I have completed the wiring, tested each component, and programmed the display to react to music. One challenge has been improving the microphone’s sensitivity and making the visualizer respond accurately to quieter sounds. My next steps are to refine the code, improve the audio input, organize the wiring, and build an enclosure for the finished project.

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
